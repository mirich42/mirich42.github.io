## More about me
My native lands are the suburbs of New York City, in a town called Dobbs Ferry. From a young age I was interested in the outdoors and the living things in my environment. I went to college in beautiful upstate New York to study biology at Cornell University, and spent time as an undergraduate working with a variety of professors on topics such as: fish behavior (Alex Flecker), fish physiology (William Bemis), a species description... of a fish (Carl Hopkins & John Sullivan), and ecological calendars (Karim-Aly Kassam). After graduating I was certain I would never pursue a graduate degree and shipped off to Maui, HI to work as a SCUBA diving instructor for what ended up being 6 years. Somehow things worked out and my curiosity in pursuing a grad program and an opening in Peter Blanken's lab overlapped, and I moved to around Boulder CO to pursue a master's degree in the Geography Department at CU Boulder. My master's research centers around analyzing a temperature and flux dataset collected over the North American Great Lakes.

## What I'm excited about learning about Earth Data Science
I came into a master's program looking to pick up practical skills to use in the job market as a data analyst/data scientist. Earth data science has been very interesting overall, and I am excited to see where the skills I learn can lead. 

## Questions I would like to answer
Broadly speaking... "is working in the field of Earth data analytics a good fit for me?" But more specifically, I have questions relating to my master's project, such as: how do the large rivers that connect the Great Lakes impact water temperatures within the Lakes?
